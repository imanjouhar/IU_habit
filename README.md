# Habit Tracking App

## Overview

The Habit Tracking App is designed as a cornerstone for personal development, fostering awareness and enhancement of daily habits which are instrumental in achieving long-term aspirations. The aim of this project is to create a Habit Tracker that acts as a reliable guide to navigate the complexities of establishing and maintaining habits. The Habit Tracking App will be accompanied with a full suite of documentation and docstrings to each code segment. The Habit Tracker promises a user-friendly onboarding experience.
The application's primary components are the Task, and Habit classes, which are developed based on the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) in Python 3.8.5. A single habit has the potential to involve multiple tasks that requires to be completed (checked) and its continuous iteration. By limiting the number of general habits included in the list and combining similar tasks in one habit, the habits will appear more user friendly.


## Key Components

- **Task Class**: Manages single tasks, each with a name, status, and an optional deadline.
- **Task Class History**: Manages history for tasks, saving more details regarding when the task has been checked off.
- **Habit Class**: Group tasks in one Category.

## Features

- Track and manage daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly habits.
- Add tasks to habits and mark them as complete.
- Analyze habit completion and task progress.
- Store data using SQLite3, ensuring persistence across sessions.
- Command Line Interface for intuitive interaction and management of habits and tasks.
